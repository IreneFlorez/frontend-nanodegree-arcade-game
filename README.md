# Udacity Front-End Development course Arcade Game Project
## This project was created to satisfy the fourth requirement in the Udacity Front-End Development course 


How to play the Game: 
In this game, you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. The player can move left, right, up and down. Use your arrow key on the keyboard to move the player in these directions. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. Once a the player collides with an enemy; the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square. Once the player reaches the water, the game is 'won' and the player is reset to start the game anew.
